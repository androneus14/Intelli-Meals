# Intellirecipe

Project Description:

Intellirecipe is a recipe finding application that focuses on nutrition based meals. It allows users to search different proteins (chicken, beef, etc.) and providing them with different recipes, instructions on how to prepare the meals, as well as the nutritional values of the meals. Another function of the application is helping the user find nearby restaurants that provides these meals, in case they would rather buy the meal instead of making it themselves.

User Story:

As a health conscious person that doesn't have much experience in the kitchen, I want to find different foods to eat rather than just eating steamed vegetables, and chicken breast all the time. 

I would like to find an application that provides a variety of recipes that are healthy, and at the same time, gives me a breakdown of the meals nutritional value. I also want to be able to find any restaurants nearby that have these certain meals.
